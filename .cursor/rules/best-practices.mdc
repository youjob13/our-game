You are an expert in TypeScript, Angular, and scalable web application development. You write functional, maintainable, performant, and accessible code following Angular and TypeScript best practices.

## Core Development Principles

**MANDATORY**: Every code change MUST follow these principles:

- **DDD (Domain-Driven Design)** - Business logic in domain layer, follow bounded contexts (see `ddd-architecture.mdc`)
- **DRY** - Extract reusable logic into functions/services. No duplicate code.
- **KISS** - Simplest solution first. Add complexity only when proven necessary.
- **YAGNI** - Implement only what's needed now. No speculative features.
- **Clean Code** - Self-documenting names, single responsibility, pure functions where possible.

## TypeScript Best Practices

- Use strict type checking
- Prefer type inference when the type is obvious
- Avoid the `any` type; use `unknown` when type is uncertain
- Extract magic numbers/strings to named constants
- Max function length: 40 lines (extract if longer)
- Max file length: 500 lines (split if longer)

## Angular Best Practices

- Always use standalone components over NgModules
- Must NOT set `standalone: true` inside Angular decorators. It's the default in Angular v20+.
- Use signals for state management
- Implement lazy loading for feature routes
- Do NOT use the `@HostBinding` and `@HostListener` decorators. Put host bindings inside the `host` object of the `@Component` or `@Directive` decorator instead
- Use `NgOptimizedImage` for all static images.
  - `NgOptimizedImage` does not work for inline base64 images.

## Accessibility Requirements

- It MUST pass all AXE checks.
- It MUST follow all WCAG AA minimums, including focus management, color contrast, and ARIA attributes.

### Components

- Keep components small and focused on a single responsibility
- Use `input()` and `output()` functions instead of decorators
- Use `computed()` for derived state
- Set `changeDetection: ChangeDetectionStrategy.OnPush` in `@Component` decorator
- Prefer inline templates for small components
- Prefer Reactive forms instead of Template-driven ones
- Do NOT use `ngClass`, use `class` bindings instead
- Do NOT use `ngStyle`, use `style` bindings instead
- When using external templates/styles, use paths relative to the component TS file.
- **NO business logic in components** - delegate to services/facades (DDD)
- **If code repeats 2+ times** - extract to shared utility/component
- **Max 3 levels of nesting** in templates - extract child components if deeper

## State Management

- Use signals for local component state
- Use `computed()` for derived state
- Keep state transformations pure and predictable
- Do NOT use `mutate` on signals, use `update` or `set` instead

## Templates

- Keep templates simple and avoid complex logic
- Use native control flow (`@if`, `@for`, `@switch`) instead of `*ngIf`, `*ngFor`, `*ngSwitch`
- Use the async pipe to handle observables
- Do not assume globals like (`new Date()`) are available.
- Do not write arrow functions in templates (they are not supported).
- Do not write Regular expressions in templates (they are not supported).

## Services

- Design services around a single responsibility
- Use the `providedIn: 'root'` option for singleton services
- Use the `inject()` function instead of constructor injection
- **Max 5 public methods per service** - split if larger
- **Shared logic goes in util libraries** - never duplicate across services
- Follow DDD layers: Domain services (business logic), Application services (orchestration), Infrastructure (HTTP/storage)

## Code Quality Enforcement

**Before writing ANY code, ask:**

1. **DRY**: Does similar code exist? Reuse it.
2. **KISS**: Is this the simplest approach? Remove unnecessary complexity.
3. **YAGNI**: Is this needed now? Skip if not.
4. **DDD**: Is business logic in domain layer? Is this the right bounded context?

**Refactoring triggers (MUST act on these):**

- Code duplication detected → Extract to function/service/component
- Function >40 lines → Split into smaller functions
- Component with business logic → Move to service/facade
- Nested conditionals >3 levels → Extract to functions with early returns
- Magic values → Extract to named constants/enums
